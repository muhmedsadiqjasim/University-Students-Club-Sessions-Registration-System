# Student Club Registration System

This is a basic web-based system designed to help university students view and register for upcoming club events. It simplifies the registration process by providing a clean and beginner-friendly interface that connects to a MySQL database using PHP.

## 📄 About the Project

The purpose of this project is to streamline the way students interact with campus events by allowing them to easily view available sessions and register for those they are interested in. The system includes features such as student information collection, club and session management, and secure event registration.
